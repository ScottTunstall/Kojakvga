# Kojakvga
My KOJAKVGA unit from 1996 (started 1994) which allows developers to create games using the extremely popular (at the time) 320x200x256 VGA mode (also known as Mode 13h) . This was published in the SourceWare Archival Group (SWAG) back in the day.

The unit supports primitives such as pixel plotting, line drawing & rectangles as well as more complicated routines such as per-pixel fine scrolling, software sprites & flipping, loading PCX graphic files.

Turbo Pascal 7 did not support 386 32-bit instructions at the time so to use them I had to find each opcode individually and insert them into the assembly directly. But it was still fun!
